# Data Structure in CityU

This repository is only for storing my assignments of CS3334 Data Structure provided by CityU.

Programming langugage is C++.


## Keyword Syllabus (https://www.cityu.edu.hk/catalogue/ug/201516/course/CS3334.pdf):

Program correctness. Complexities of programs: notation, average and worst case analysis, complexities of common programming constructs. Sorting algorithms: merge sort, heap sort, quicksort, bucket sort. Algorithms for order statistics. Abstract data types: stacks, queues, heaps. Balanced search trees: AVL trees, red-black trees, 2-3 trees, B-trees. Hash tables. Merge-find sets.

Syllabus:
1. Program correctness and complexities
Techniques for proving program correctness, e.g., loop invariant and induction. Asymptotic
notations for program complexities. Summation and recurrence formulas. Complexities of
common programming constructs, e.g., loops and recursive programs. Average and worst case
analysis.
2. Sorting algorithms
Selected sorting algorithms, such as merge sort, heap sort, quicksort, bucket sort, radix sort, as
examples to illustrate the previous concepts and analysis techniques. Algorithms for order
statistics.
3. Review of abstract data types
Principles of abstract data types. Examples: stacks, queues, heaps.
4. Search trees
Binary search trees. Balanced search trees: AVL trees, red-black trees, 2-3 trees, B-trees.
5. Hash tables
Direct addressing. Hash functions. Collision resolution.
6. Merge-find sets
Disjoint set operations. Path compression. Ackermannâ€™s function.
